The `resources/lang` directory is typically used to store language files for localization in a Laravel application. Since you haven't specified any particular language or content, I will create a default English language file named `en.json` for you.

Here are the contents for the file `resources/lang/en.json`:

{
    "welcome": "Welcome to our application!",
    "goodbye": "Thank you for visiting!",
    "error": "An error occurred. Please try again.",
    "success": "Operation completed successfully.",
    "login": {
        "title": "Login",
        "email": "Email Address",
        "password": "Password",
        "remember_me": "Remember Me",
        "submit": "Login"
    },
    "register": {
        "title": "Register",
        "name": "Name",
        "email": "Email Address",
        "password": "Password",
        "confirm_password": "Confirm Password",
        "submit": "Register"
    }
}
