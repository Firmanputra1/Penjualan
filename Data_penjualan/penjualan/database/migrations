The `/penjualan/penjualan/database/migrations` directory is intended to contain migration files for creating and modifying database tables. Since you haven't specified any particular migration files to create, I will provide a sample migration file that you can use as a starting point.

Here is the content for a sample migration file named `2023_10_01_000000_create_users_table.php`:

<?php

use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;
use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

class CreateUsersTable extends Migration
{
    public function up()
    {
        Schema::create('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->id();
            $table->string('name');
            $table->string('email')->unique();
            $table->timestamp('email_verified_at')->nullable();
            $table->string('password');
            $table->rememberToken();
            $table->timestamps();
        });
    }

    public function down()
    {
        Schema::dropIfExists('users');
    }
}

You can create additional migration files in this directory as needed for your application.
